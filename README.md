# Blog App
This is a MVP of BlogApp I created based on ASP.NET Razor Pages using Entity Framework (code first) for the data access and SQL Server as a database.
I've also used Identity for the login functionality.

# Functionality
- Each user has its own web posts that he can manage
- Only logged in users can see the posts
- Role-based accounts (admin and client) that have different functionality - Admin can delete all posts, the client only his own
- Registration (new account is selected as a client) and Logging
- Updating Posts
